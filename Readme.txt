* The data I've used for the project has been scrapped from  https://laptop-finder.co.uk/ for educational purposes.
* For the design I have used MSI page and the newEGG dark version as examples. I am not a designer so i kept it as simple as i could also didn't add much animation in terms of self preference.
* In JSON data there is single picture per product so in store page you will be seeing the same picture rotated horizontalyy instead of a new picture for the exact product or a selector of pictures.
* The project is in state of development so there are some temporary styles and some that has't been touched at all. By the time you read it they might already be fixed.
* As i progress in this project i notice parts of my code could have been written in more proefficent way and after finishing it as a whole I a might update them. 
* At this point store page is almost complited with its dynamic filtering, sortings,pagination and comparison.
* Unfinished parts are: Detailed page for single product, Blogs page, About page, Profile page after logging in, Basket page and Searchbar functionallity.
* I could have added MailChimp api to email subscription in footer, but don't see any point on that. Rigth now it sends your email to Redux Store.
* I haven't deployed the project yet, to check it please download and use npm install and run.

*** Note: Lately I'm mostly busy with learning and experimenting new stuff so this project has low priority at the moment.(I will be updating it rarely)
