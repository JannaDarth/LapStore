Data i use for the preject has been scrapped from  https://laptop-finder.co.uk/ for educational purposes.
For the design i have used as examples MSI page and the newEGG dark version. I am not a designer so i kept it as simple as i could also didn't add much animation in terms of self preference.
In my data i have single picture per product so in store page you will be seeing the same picture rotated horizontalyy instead of a new picture for the exact product or a selector for pictures.
project is still in progress so there are some temporary styles and some that has't been touched at all. by the time you read it they might already be fixed.
As i progress in this project i notice parts of my code could have been written on more proefficent way and after finishing it a might come back to edit them.
