* The data I use for the preject has been scrapped from  https://laptop-finder.co.uk/ for educational purposes.
* For the design I have used MSI page and the newEGG dark version as examples. I am not a designer so i kept it as simple as i could also didn't add much animation in terms of self preference.
* In JSON data there is single picture per product so in store page you will be seeing the same picture rotated horizontalyy instead of a new picture for the exact product or a selector of pictures.
* The project is still in progress so there are some temporary styles and some that has't been touched at all.By the time you read it they might already be fixed.
* As i progress in this project i notice parts of my code could have been written on more proefficent way and after finishing it a might come back to edit them. 
* At this point store page is almost complited with its dynamic filtering, sortings and pagination. Comparison component on prgoress.

*** Note: Lately I'm mostly busy with learning and experimenting new stuff so this project is not the priority at the moment.(the progress will be slow)
