* The data I use for the preject has been scrapped from  https://laptop-finder.co.uk/ for educational purposes.
* For the design I have used MSI page and the newEGG dark version as examples. I am not a designer so i kept it as simple as i could also didn't add much animation in terms of self preference.
* In JSON data there is single picture per product so in store page you will be seeing the same picture rotated horizontalyy instead of a new picture for the exact product or a selector of pictures.
* The project is in state of development so there are some temporary styles and some that has't been touched at all. By the time you read it they might already be fixed.
* As i progress in this project i notice parts of my code could have been written in more proefficent way and after finishing it a might come back to edit them. 
* At this point store page is almost complited with its dynamic filtering, sortings and pagination. Comparison component in progress.
* I haven't deployed the project yet, to check it please download and use npm install and run.

*** Note: Lately I'm mostly busy with learning and experimenting new stuff so this project is not the priority at the moment.(I will be rarely updating this one)
